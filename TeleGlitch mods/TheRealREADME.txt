Welcome to The Real README, because the README is mostly just a flashy showcase and no installation information


**************************
		Installation - Doom Start
**************************

	Go to this folder:
		...\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\TeleglitchDME\level1
		
		Then you replace the files with the same name:
 			• objects.lua		-- Not so important, it is just for some few more monsters, so the first map is not THAT boring.
			• script.lua		-- This is for the changes of the intro text-dialog.
			
		
		
	And then last but not least, this folder:
		...\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\TeleglitchDME\lua
		
		Here you replace
			• ddeweapons.lua	-- This is the real weapon layout of the starting gear. 



**************************
		Installation - New Random Equipment
**************************

	Go to this folder:
		...\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\TeleglitchDME\lua

		And replace
			• ddeweapons.lua	-- The bottom of the file is full of Random Starting Gears. 



**************************
		Installation - Doom Start in Random
**************************

	Same as above - New Random Equipment.
	It is the same as Doom start, it is just in the random starting gear as the only new addition.
